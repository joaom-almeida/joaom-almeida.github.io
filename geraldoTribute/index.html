            <h2>Timeline of Geraldo's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Born in Jo&atilde;o Pessoa, PB</li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong> - Moved to Rio de Janeiro</li>
                <li><strong>1961</strong> - Graduated from law school</li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> - Launched his first phonograph record, self-titled</li>
                <li><strong>1966</strong> - Won first place at broadcaster Record's "Festival de Música Popular Brasileira"</li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Participated in broadcaster Globo's "Festival Internacional da Can&ccedil;&atilde;o" with his most famous song, "Pra n&atilde;o Dizer que n&atilde;o Falei das Flores". The song became an anthem for the student movement against Brazil's military dictatorship</li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Was exiled due to his song, hiding in a friend's farm initially, but fled to a multitude of other countries</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Came back from his exile, and was interviewed by Globo about it. Said interview was also censored and never released. Rumors said he became crazy due to the tortures he'd have suffered during the dictatorship</li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Acted as a lawyer, abandoning his musical career due to the military persecution</li>
                <li><strong>1995</strong> - Presented his first show in Brazil after coming back from exile</li>
                <li><strong>2010</strong> - After many years of insigificant shows, Geraldo conceded a polemic interview to Globo, where he said he has never been tortured. Many say his denial is insane, a consequence of the tortures</li>
                <li><strong>2021</strong> - After a few other shows over the years, Geraldo lives peacefully in S&atilde;o Paulo</li>
            </ul>
